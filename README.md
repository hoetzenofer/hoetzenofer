## Hey there!

---

I'm **Hoetzenofer**, a young programmer from Austria.
Due to my current school situation, I usually don't have that much time for programming, but I still try to do my best :)

---

**My current projects**
- Raspberry PI Greenhouse
- Smart-Room System with Raspberry PI
- 32-Bit Protected Mode OS with Bootloader and Kernel

---

My favorite languages are _C++, C, Python and x86 Assembly_. However, I mainly write in Python.
I also know how to program in _C#_, I don't really like it tho.
Sometimes I write a bit of _Java_ (only for Minecraft Mods) and _Lua_ (only for my NVIM Config).

As you can see, I use Python for many of my smaller projects, since it's quick and easy to write and great for debugging.
